        <h1>Homework 2: Gemini Cookbook </h1>
<p>Your goal is to develop a small proof-of-concept NLP application using a generative AI model, inspired by Google's 
    <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">Gemini API Cookbook</a> examples.
    The focus is on learning to use a generative language model in a practical application, integrating it with other tools or data, and documenting your process.</p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>By the end of this homework, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explore and understand the Gemini Cookbook examples for generative AI applications</li>
  <li>Design a proof-of-concept NLP application that leverages a generative model</li>
  <li>Craft effective prompts and manage the model’s outputs to address a specific NLP task</li>
  <li>Integrate an external API or data source (e.g., web search, dataset retrieval, or code execution) to enrich your application</li>
  <li>Document your project design, implementation challenges, and results in a structured report</li>
  <li>Submit both your code (e.g., a Python notebook) and the written report</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Explore the Gemini Cookbook Examples:</strong> Start by reviewing the 
        <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">Gemini API Cookbook examples</a>.
        These examples illustrate how to combine multiple AI features or third-party tools to build complex applications.
        <ul>
          <li>Notice how each example uses the Gemini generative model for NLP tasks (e.g., text generation, answering questions)</li>
          <li>Identify any additional features or integrations, such as using a search engine for grounding facts or executing code in response to a prompt</li>
          <li><em>Tip:</em> You do not need to run all the code – even reading through the examples and their descriptions can give you insight</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Your Project Idea:</strong> Based on what you observed in the examples, think of a small NLP application you would like to build. It should involve <strong>generative AI</strong> (e.g., using the Gemini API or a similar language model) and ideally one additional integration (another tool, dataset, or API). 
        Feel free to be creative – the goal is to come up with your own twist rather than copying an example.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan Your Solution:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input/Output:</strong> Define what input the user will provide and what output the application should generate.</li>
          <li><strong>Role of Generative AI:</strong> Decide how you will use the generative model (e.g., answering questions, creating content, summarizing text). Sketch out example prompts you might use.</li>
          <li><strong>Integration (if any):</strong> Determine which external tool or data you might need. This might include:
            <ul>
              <li>An API call to fetch information (like a web search or database query).</li>
              <li>Utilizing a library or tool that complements the generative AI (e.g., for code execution).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Map out a step-by-step process for your application. For example: "User asks a question → App fetches related data → Generative model creates a final answer."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Implement the Application:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the Gemini API via the provided SDK (or an alternative model) to implement the core functionality.</li>
          <li>Develop your solution according to your plan. Keep your code simple, clear, and well-commented.</li>
          <li>Document key steps, such as API calls to the generative model and any integrations, directly in your code.</li>
          <li>If necessary, refine your prompt or add post-processing steps to manage the model's output.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test and Refine:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Run your application on several sample inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.</li>
          <li>Analyze the outputs and adjust your approach if the results are not as intended.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document Your Work:</strong> Write a brief report following the <a href="#documentation">Documentation Requirements</a> below. Explain what you built, how it works, and discuss your results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Submission:</strong> Submit both your code (as a Python script or notebook) and your written report. Ensure your code is runnable and include clear instructions, without hard-coding API keys.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Project Scope and Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The project should be more involved than a single API call but limited in scope. </li>
      <li><strong>Use of Generative AI:</strong> Your application must use a generative model for a core part of the functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Integration of Features/APIs:</strong> Include at least one integration, such as an external data source/API or a secondary feature (like function calling or code execution).</li>
      
      
      <li><strong>Use of Existing Code:</strong> You may reuse snippets from the Gemini Cookbook for reference but make sure to cite.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working with partner is encouraged. Submit the work separately.</li>
